\title{Compute subject-specific transition probabilities
using a convolution algorithm based on the Fast Fourier transform.}
\usage{
probtrans_fft(initial_state, cumhaz, max_time, nr_steps = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{initial_state}{The present function 
estimates state occupation probabilities from the state given
in this argument.}

\item{cumhaz}{An \code{msfit} object created by running
\code{mstate} or \code{mstate_generic}.}

\item{max_time}{The maximum time for which transition probabilities
are estimated.}

\item{nr_steps}{The number of steps in the convolution algorithm
(larger increases precision but makes it slower)}
}
\value{
An object of class 'probtrans'. See the 'value' 
section in the help page of \code{mstate::probtrans}.

\description{
Compute subject-specific transition probabilities
using a convolution algorithm based on the Fast Fourier transform.
}
\details{
The \code{time} argument is crucial for precision.
The density of time points and
the upper time limit should
be increased until the estimated curves become stable.
A useful rule of thumb is to set the upper time limit
to a time point in which the
probability of each transient state is zero and the probability of
each absorbing state is constant.

For the same approximation grid, \code{probtrans_fft} doesnâ€™t
always yield the same result as \code{probtrans_ebmstate}
(semi-Markov version), even though they are meant to approximate
exactly the same convolution. \code{probtrans_ebmstate} is
sensitive to the grid interval size, but not such much to the
maximum grid time. \code{probtrans_fft} is sensitive to both
these parameters, as referred above.

The algorithm behind \code{probtrans_ebmstate} is based
on the convolution of density and survival functions and
is suitable for processes with a tree-like transition
structure only.
